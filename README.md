# Modular Badminton Business Running System

A comprehensive, microservices-based system for managing all aspects of a badminton business, from court reservations to equipment maintenance, with data-driven insights and real-time capabilities.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The system follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

### Core Services
- **User Management Service** (Port 8000) - Authentication, authorization, user profiles
- **Court Reservation Service** (Port 8001) - Booking logic, dynamic pricing, waitlist
- **Match Scoring Service** (Port 8002) - Real-time scoring, player stats, match history
- **Inventory & Maintenance Service** (Port 8003) - Product management, equipment tracking
- **Analytics Service** (Port 8004) - Reports, visualizations, data export
- **API Gateway** (Port 8080) - Single entry point, routing, authentication

### Supporting Infrastructure
- **PostgreSQL** - Primary database for all services
- **Redis** - Caching and session storage
- **Docker** - Containerization and orchestration

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.11+ (for local development)
- PostgreSQL (if running locally)

### Using Docker (Recommended)

1. **Clone and navigate to the project:**
   ```bash
   cd badminton_system
   ```

2. **Start all services:**
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker/docker compose.yml up -d
   ```

3. **Check service health:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/health/services
   ```

4. **Access the API Gateway:**
   - Main API: http://localhost:8080
   - API Documentation: http://localhost:8080/docs

### Local Development

1. **Set up each service individually:**
   ```bash
   # User Service
   cd user_service
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   uvicorn main:app --port 8000 --reload

   # Court Reservation Service
   cd ../court_reservation
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   uvicorn main:app --port 8001 --reload

   # Continue for other services...
   ```

2. **Start the API Gateway:**
   ```bash
   cd api_gateway
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   uvicorn main:app --port 8080 --reload
   ```

- Court Service: http://localhost:8001/docs
- Match Service: http://localhost:8002/docs
- Inventory Service: http://localhost:8003/docs
- Analytics Service: http://localhost:8004/docs
- API Gateway: http://localhost:8080/docs

### Sample Data
Services automatically create sample data on startup for testing purposes.

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
Each service can be configured using environment variables:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://user:pass@host:port/db

# JWT
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# Service URLs (API Gateway)
USER_SERVICE_URL=http://user_service:8000
COURT_SERVICE_URL=http://court_service:8001
# ... etc
```

## üöÄ Deployment

### Production Deployment
1. **Update environment variables** in `docker/docker compose.yml`
2. **Configure secrets management** (replace hardcoded secrets)
3. **Set up reverse proxy** (nginx) for SSL termination
4. **Configure monitoring** (Prometheus, Grafana)
5. **Set up log aggregation** (ELK stack)

### Scaling
- Each service can be scaled independently
- Use Kubernetes for advanced orchestration
- Implement load balancing for high availability

## üìà Performance Considerations

- **Database Indexing** - Proper indexes on frequently queried columns
- **Connection Pooling** - SQLAlchemy connection pools
- **Caching** - Redis for session and frequently accessed data
- **Async Operations** - FastAPI's async capabilities for I/O operations
